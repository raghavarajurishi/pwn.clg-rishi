# File Globbing

## Matching with *
The first glob we'll learn is *. When it encounters a * character in any argument, the shell will treat it as a "wildcard" and try to replace that argument with any files that match the pattern. It's easier to show you than explain:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_*
Look: file_a file_b file_c
Of course, though in this case, the glob resulted in multiple arguments, it can just as simply match only one. For example:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_*
Look: file_a
When zero files are matched, by default, the shell leaves the glob unchanged:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: nope_*
Look: nope_*
The * matches any part of the filename except for / or a leading . character. For example:

hacker@dojo:~$ echo ONE: /ho*/*ck*
ONE: /home/hacker
hacker@dojo:~$ echo TWO: /*/hacker
TWO: /home/hacker
hacker@dojo:~$ echo THREE: ../*
THREE: ../hacker
Now, practice this yourself! Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use globbing to keep the argument you pass to cd to at most four characters! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{U-PzZS62xw_v7RBulbksAhouILE.QXxIDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}`

To find the flag we should open challenge directory with using * glob and we should specify the path using less than 5 charecters.After opening the challenge directory we should enter /challenge/run inorder to find the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{U-PzZS62xw_v7RBulbksAhouILE.QXxIDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}
```

* is a glob which will try to replace that argument with any files that match the pattern.

## Matching with ?
Next, let's learn about ?. When it encounters a ? character in any argument, the shell will treat it as a single-character wildcard. This works like *, but only matches one character. For example:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_cc
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_cc
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_?
Look: file_a file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_??
Look: file_cc
Now, practice this yourself! Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use the ? character instead of c and l in the argument to cd! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4ttkmHViSvhNGNM8OlMSkPwNzDu.QXyIDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}`

To get the flag we should open challenge directory but we should use ? instead of c and l charecters and use /challenge/run to get the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4ttkmHViSvhNGNM8OlMSkPwNzDu.QXyIDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
? is a glob like * but ? replaces only a single-character.

## Matching with []
Next, we will cover []. The square brackets are, essentially, a limited form of ?, in that instead of matching any character, [] is a wildcard for some subset of potential characters, specified within the brackets. For example, [pwn] will match the character p, w, or n. For example:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_[ab]
Look: file_a file_b
Try it here! We've placed a bunch of files in /challenge/files. Change your working directory to /challenge/files and run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QEBq_8C6Ws4OhNAwlMmJ1kjL4lK.QXzIDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}`

In order to get the flag I should open files directory and use [] glob and give it "bash" parameters to get to the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files/
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{QEBq_8C6Ws4OhNAwlMmJ1kjL4lK.QXzIDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
[] is a wildcard for some subset of potential characters.

### References

## Matching paths with []
Globbing happens on a path basis, so you can expand entire paths with your globbed arguments. For example:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: /home/hacker/file_[ab]
Look: /home/hacker/file_a /home/hacker/file_b
Now it's your turn. Once more, we've placed a bunch of files in /challenge/files. Starting from your home directory, run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into the absolute paths to the file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h files!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wt7rtfM7wAYIQyk5OAb_naCz0R4.QX0IDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}`

I should give absolute paths to the flag files and use [] and give it "bash" as parameter.

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{wt7rtfM7wAYIQyk5OAb_naCz0R4.QX0IDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
[] can also be used when given absolute path.

### References

## Multiple globs
So far, you've specified one glob at a time, but you can do more! Bash supports the expansion of multiple globs in a single word. For example:

hacker@dojo:~$ cat /*fl*
pwn.college{YEAH}
hacker@dojo:~$
What happens above is that the shell looks for all files in / that start with anything (including nothing), then have an f and an l, and end in anything (including ag, which makes flag).

Now you try it. We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and run /challenge/run, providing a single argument: a short (3 characters or less) globbed word with two * globs in it that covers every word that contains the letter p.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gGHf26pMGoniywMlkrGPPp-KY8b.0lM3kjNxwyNwIzNzEzW}`

To get the flag we should first open the files directory and give a multiple glob command such that it inculdes every word that contains letter p. By entering *p* we will get the flag as it covers every p word.

```bash
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{gGHf26pMGoniywMlkrGPPp-KY8b.0lM3kjNxwyNwIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
Multiple globs can be used.

## Mixing globs
Now, let's put the previous levels together! We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and, using the globbing you've learned, write a single, short (6 characters or less) glob that (when passed as an argument to /challenge/run) will match the files "challenging", "educational", and "pwning"!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible. Use triple ticks for any bash commands and output you type on the terminal.

```bash
command 1
command 2
pwn.college{helloworld}
```

## Exclusionary globbing
Sometimes, you want to filter out files in a glob! Luckily, [] helps you do just this. If the first character in the brackets is a ! or (in newer versions of bash) a ^, the glob inverts, and that bracket instance matches characters that aren't listed. For example:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_[!ab]
Look: file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_[^ab]
Look: file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_[ab]
Look: file_a file_b
Armed with this knowledge, go forth to /challenge/files and run /challenge/run with all files that don't start with p, w, or n!

NOTE: The ! character has a different special meaning in bash when it's not the first character of a [] glob, so keep that in mind if things stop making sense! ^ does not have this problem, but is also not compatible with older shells.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{E4hW-BpU5XIRKRAcgobRJEry0Jc.QX2IDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}`

We should print the words which doesnt have p,w,n as their starting characters. By entering [!pwn]*,we will get the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [!pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{E4hW-BpU5XIRKRAcgobRJEry0Jc.QX2IDO0wyNwIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
By using ! it wont show those parameters.

## Tab completion
As tempting as it might be, using * to shorten what must be typed on the commandline can lead to mistakes. Your glob might expand to unintended files, and you might not spot it until the rm command is already running! No one is safe from this style of error.

A safer alternative when you are trying to specify a specific target is tab completion. If you hit tab in the shell, it'll try to figure out what you're going to type and automatically complete it. Auto-completion is super useful, and this challenge will explore its use in specifying files.

This challenge has copied the flag into /challenge/pwncollege, and you can freely cat that file. But you can't type the filename: we used some serious trickery to make sure that you must tab-complete it. Try it out!

hacker@dojo:~$ ls /challenge
DESCRIPTION.md  pwncollege
hacker@dojo:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollege
cat: /challenge/pwncollege: No such file or directory
hacker@dojo:~$ cat /challenge/pwn<TAB>
pwn.college{HECK YEAH}
hacker@dojo:~$
When you hit that tab key, the name will expand and you'll be able to read the file. Good luck!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EMPym07fjK98MilDxL5-A4Leae3.0FN0EzNxwyNwIzNzEzW}`

We should click tab to complete the path inorder to get the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollege​ 
pwn.college{EMPym07fjK98MilDxL5-A4Leae3.0FN0EzNxwyNwIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
By hitting tab it completes the incomplete

## Multiple options for tab completion
Consider the following situation:

hacker@dojo:~$ ls
flag  flamingo  flowers
hacker@dojo:~$ cat f<TAB>
There are multiple options! What happens?

What happens varies based on the specific shell and its options. By default bash will auto-expand until the first point when there are multiple options (in this case, fl). When you hit tab a second time, it'll print out those options. Other shells and configurations, instead, will cycle through the options.

This challenge has a /challenge/files directory with a bunch of files starting with pwncollege. Tab-complete from /challenge/files/p or so, and make your way to the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AE-b2xSPgx7Xd5o93zV9OLxhDjV.0lN0EzNxwyNwIzNzEzW}`

In order to get to the flag we should hit tab when there are multiple options starting with fl.

```bash
hacker@globbing~multiple-options-for-tab-completion:/challenge/files$ cat /challenge/files/pwncollege-fl
pwncollege-flag        pwncollege-flamingo    pwncollege-flyswatter
hacker@globbing~multiple-options-for-tab-completion:/challenge/files$ cat /challenge/files/pwncollege-flag
pwn.college{AE-b2xSPgx7Xd5o93zV9OLxhDjV.0lN0EzNxwyNwIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
By hitting tab it shows you multiple options starting with same letter continues till there are no common characters left.

## Tab completion on commands
Tab completion is for more than files! You can also tab-complete commands. This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag. Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

NOTE: You can auto-complete any command, but be careful: callous auto-completes without double-checking the result can wreak havoc in your shell if you accidentally run the wrong commands!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IVkZgzg1_OHqYSviU3LdYYt1mv4.0VN0EzNxwyNwIzNzEzW}`

tTo get the flag we should hit tab after entering pwncollege.

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-16599 
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IVkZgzg1_OHqYSviU3LdYYt1mv4.0VN0EzNxwyNwIzNzEzW}
```
